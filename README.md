>To minimize the feature redundancy of multisource and maximize the complementary advantages of multisource, a Dual-Stream Transformer with Diff-attention (DSTD)-Net is proposed for multisource remote sensing classification in this paper. Firstly, in terms of feature extraction, we use a Self-attention and Co-attention (SCA) block to extract both specific advantageous features and common essential features. Based on that, a self-attention module strengthened by diff-attention (SSDA) that pays attention to the difference between two specific advantageous features is designed to reduce the essential redundancy in specific features. It can take advantage of the difference between two specific features and reduce the essential redundancy of the specific advantageous features, making them purer and better for classification. Finally, since the specific features and common features of MS and PAN images make different contributions to classification, a Multi-stage Gated Fusion (MGF) strategy is used. The MGF strategy mainly uses Gated multisource units (GMU) to adapt the weight of different features and fuse them. So our MGF strategy can strengthen the specific advantageous features beneficial for classification and weaken the common features.Above all, the several experiment results verify our proposed networksâ€™ effectiveness and robustness.<br>
